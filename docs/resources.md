## [GitHub](https://github.com/)
Yes, let\`s start from the site, where this course is located, so what is that? Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds — the same person who created Linux. But Git is a command-line tool and the most popular centre around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub — GitHub.com — where developers store their projects and network with like-minded people.

## [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
If you have some troubles during first year writing the code on any language, the solution is here. If there is no solution, you are searching in the wrong way.

## [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
Everyone knows about Wikipedia. But there you can\`t find a solution to your problems with a program or system in general. On the Arch wiki, there are millions of solutions to every problem, a lot of manuals and documentation to every program, not only for the Arch, but other systems too.

## [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
It is (maybe) the most popular forum where you also can find a lot of helpful staff and discuss topics with other geeks.

## [Harbr](https://habr.com/ru/)
Interesting site with a lot of programming world news on Russian.
