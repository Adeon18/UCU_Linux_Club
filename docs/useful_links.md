## Links
#### Arch Linux installation
Arch Linux itself is not very simple for beginners, but amazing if you want to know the system better. So I propose you few links where you can read about the Arch Linux installation. The main parts are distro installation and graphics. So the best manual is [on Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide). But a lot of you maybe want to have few distros. Then you can use [this](https://sollus-soft.blogspot.com/2017/01/arch-linux-windows-10-uefi-systemd-boot.html?m=1) manual. Also, if you want simpler man, than on the Arch wiki, you can take [this one](https://sollus-soft.blogspot.com/2017/01/arch-linux-64-uefi-systemd-boot-grub.html?m=1). And the instruction about graphic drivers installation can be found [here](https://ziggi.org/ustanovka-i-nastroyka-arch-linux-xfce-chast-1/). But you don\`t need XFCE, instead you need [GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME).
