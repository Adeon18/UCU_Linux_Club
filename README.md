# Linux Club 2020
UCU Linux club 20/21 repo with the schedule, useful links and presentations.

I\`ll try to make a schedule for the first semester (12 weeks). Not a lot, but let it be. It has to be like a full course.

### First presentation.
Presentation link: (LINK HERE)

### Pre-requirements:
#### Very important:
- Personal laptop.
- [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on your PC (not VM) or other Arch-based systems (Can be [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/gnome/), but NOT Debian- or Fedora-based systems. The manual for Arch Linux installation is [here](LINK HERE)
- Basic knowledge of English language (the course is for UCU students so it is not going to be a problem, I hope).
- Desire to learn something new and useful, that will assist you throughout your career.
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Webcams on during online presentations.

#### Can be useful before the course:

- Watching the Revolution OS movie either in [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vW62KqKJ5A) (what is better) or in [Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1F_MfLRlX0)
