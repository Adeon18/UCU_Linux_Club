# For mentors
Please, don`t make commits directly to the repo, especially if you are implementing some feature that needs to be tested and checked, as manual or some interesting code. Instead of that, make a branch with a name of such a feature, test everything and only then merge branches
# For outer developers
If you want to make your contribution in such useful project, you can make it in a few ways
- open an Issue and describe, what do you think about materials, schedule etc, what is good or bed (in your opinion), give a feedback.
- fork, make changes and create PR, as to all projects :smile:.
## What help we need?
- suggestions for next semester & future in general
